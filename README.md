# Simple Staker

WIP

## `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## `npm run deploy`

Deploys to GH pages

## `npm run recompile`

Recompiles the reach contract.
Can be useful if you have the react dev server already running.

## `npm run test`

Runs the cli test against local ALGO devnet.
(This is a bit deceptive, because it doesn't actually use your local npm;
instead it uses reach run.)
